Think about the different criteria that are relevant, and the different possible options that are available; can you identify a series of questions you can answer which will determine the best place?
On campus, off campus?
Cheap or expensive?
Cafe or shop?
Hot or cold?
Type of Food? (Asian, burgers, sandwich, full cooked meal?)


Produce some pseudo code that expresses the process described by your flowchart.
Start
Ask "On campus or off campus"
if on campus
	Ask "hot food or cold food"
	if hot
		Ask "burgers, general meals or other"
		if burgers
			goto tommy's kitchen
		else if general meals
			goto Founders Dinning Hall
		else
			goto The Hub
		endif
	else
		ask "cafe or shop"
		if shop
			goto The union Shop
		else
			goto Boilerhouse
		endif
	endif	
else
	goto KW's
endif
End
