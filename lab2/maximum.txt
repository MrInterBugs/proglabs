If you have the ability to compare two numbers and say which one is bigger, how do you find the maximum of a set of three numbers?
You compear one with the other and discard the smallest one. Then compare the "largest" one with the final number and dsicard the smallest one.

Start
Array of numbers
i = 0
large = 0
currentnum = firstnuminarray
while i <= size of array
	if large >= currentnum
		currentnum = nextnuminarray
		i = i + 1
	else
		large = i
		currentnum = nextnuminarray
		i = i + 1
print large
End
